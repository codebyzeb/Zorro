## Singular vs Plural Nouns

1. Started with nouns identified by human annotators
2. Plural nouns were removed manually by American-English native speaker. 
Annotators were given the instruction: "Does the word fit the slot in Look at these _ ?"

## Scoring edge cases:

- Should be scored as correct, but currently is not:

                look                 look
                  at                   at
                that                 that
              smooth               smooth
              [MASK]                 ##ie
